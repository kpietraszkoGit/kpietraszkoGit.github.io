# Gradle build error

Gradle build. What can possibly go wrong?
```bash
> Task :backend:compileJava FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':backend:compileJava'.
> Unable to enhance class : /path/to/Class
```

In one of the applications I work with I get this error from time to time.

What helps then is stopping an existing gradle
```bash
./gradlew --stop
```
and retrying :)
