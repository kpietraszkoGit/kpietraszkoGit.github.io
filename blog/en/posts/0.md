# Running a single JavaScript Mocha test with IntelliJ

I had an idea to minimize the number of tools I use on a daily basis, at work. I decided to run all the commands directly from Terminal within IntelliJ IDE or, preferably, use IntelliJ plugins.

Using Gradle or VCS integration mechanisms were worth trying.

[NPM Script Runner](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10297-npm-script-runner) by [syuchan1005](https://twitter.com/syu_chan_1005) and [NodeJS plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6098-nodejs) were good too.

However, once I decided to run a single JavaScript test case. Without adding `only` modifier to my `describe` and `it` functions from [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Just by using the context menu or `ctrl + shift + R` keyboard shortcut.

I had a first line in my _spec_ file like:
```javascript
import { expect } from 'general-tool/test';
```
where `general-tool` was something like a general dependency, with `test` sub-module "wrapping" Mocha.

Yes, lovely ES6 import. Probably the only unsupported ES6 feature...

For some reason (the mentioned wrapper) I didn't have a clear dependency on Babel or other transpilers, able to translate ES6 import for me.

I tried to run everything with [`--experimental-modules` Node option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_experimental_modules):
![IntelliJ Node configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mat3e/mat3e.github.io/master/blog/img/node_config.png)

Additionally, to make this option work, it is needed to change file extensions from `js` to `mjs`. Like "modular" or something...

I thought it would work, but it didn't. I got almost the same errors as previously:

```javascript
/usr/local/bin/node --experimental-modules /full/path/to/file.spec.js

I had ES6 import, but `general-tool/test` file used Node-like export (`module.exports`). I just changed my code into `describe.only`, `it.only` and run everything with standard `npm test`, but I guess the mentioned import/export inconsistency was the reason of the failure.
